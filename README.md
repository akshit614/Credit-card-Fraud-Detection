**Algorithms used in this project**
 -> Logistic Regression
 -> Random Forest Classification
 -> Decision Tree Classification

# Steps in building this project

**Data importing**
 -> Import the dataset from Kaggle
 -> Unzip the dataset and use it
**Steps in data preprocessing**
 -> Gaining insights and information about data
 -> Visualizing data
 -> Checking balance of target feature
 -> Balancing the unbalanced dataset using undersampling 
 -> Scaling columns
**Building Models and Training**
 -> Import machine learning algorithms from Scikit-learn library
 -> split the data-set into traning and testing sets
 -> build the machine learning models
 -> evaluate each model on testing set
 -> choose the best model based on performance
**Conclusion**
 -> In the end we have come on this conclusion Logistic regression accuracy is 81.3% Random Forest classification accuracy is 95.9% Decision Tree classification accuracy is 95.3%
 -> By this we get to know that the Random Forest classification is best algo on this dataset
